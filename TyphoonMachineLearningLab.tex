%\emph{Find a statistical method which uses only Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) best track typhoon data during or before year $n$ to hind-cast the entire best track of all typhoons in years $n+1$.   Given only the latter typhoons' initial three best track points (i.e. at $t=0,6,$ and $12$ hours), the maximum position error at each hind-casted track point must be less than 500 km. The method must work for the three most recent years of published best track data.}

  The enormous devastation caused by super typhoon Haiyan (2013) motivates us to consider whether data from past typhoons hold a key to predicting the grade (``category'') of an emerging tropical storm from early best track data (lat, lon, windspeed and pressure in the first 18 hours). In particular, we describe the ensemble approach to machine learning (ML) classification and the utilize MATLAB's Machine Learning Toolbox to create an ensemble based model prediction script. We train the mdoel using 2009-2014 best-track data and validate it using 2015 data.}

\section{Introduction}

  In November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines with sustained wind speeds of nearly 200
miles per hour, claiming over 6,000 lives, displacing 4 million people, damaging over a million houses,
and resulting in a request for over 750 million dollars
in humanitarian aid. Devastation caused by
``super typhoons" like Haiyan makes the on-going
development of early warning systems an absolute
necessity to provide vulnerable communities sufficient preparation time to
mitigate damage to both life and property. This motivates us to apply Machine Learning algorithms to predict th Machine Learning category, wind speed and location of emerging typhoons.

\section{Supervised Machine Learning}

Supervised Machine learning (ML) utilizes a training data set to develop a model which includes one or more input variables called \emph{predictors} and outputs the value of a variable called a \emph{response}.  For example, our predictors might be data for  the lat, lon, pressure and windspeed of an emerging tropical storm, and response might be the grade of the typhoon (3,4, or 5) or its  maximum wind (any value  35 km/hr or greater).  When the response is a discrete set, such as is the case for typhoon grade, we use a \emph{categorical} SML algorithm. When the response is continuous, such as maximum wind speed, we use a \emph{regression} algorithm.  In this lab, we do not consider \emph{unsupervised} ML algorithms where the response variables are not known in advance, and hence not specified in the training data set.  

Once a model has been developed using the training data set, it can be validated using a \emph{validation} data set. 
A validated model can then be used for new data

In our case, we will use Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) data for 2009-2014 as training data:

\begin{itemize}
\item Predictor Variables: Lat, Lon, WS and Pressure at times $t=0,6,12,18$ hours.
\item Response Variables: Grade, maximum wind speed.
\end{itemize}
{\flushleft We use} JMA data for 2015-2016 as our validation set.  For a quasi-operational (``hind-casting") model, our "new" data is JMA data for 2017.


There are a number of basic supervised ML algorithms \cite{Bon} such as

\begin{itemize}
    \item Decision Tree 
    \item Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    \item K nearest neighbors
    \item Ensemble
\end{itemize}

{\flushleft In} this chapter, we consider the ensemble approach.

\section{Ensemble Classification}


\section{MATLAB's ML Toolbox}
Using MATLAB's classification app (included in the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox) the confusion matrix (Figure \ref{fig1}) indicates that 47 Grade 5 typhoons are correctly predicted, with 13 false positive (8 Grad 4 and 5 Grade 3) and 16 False Negative (7 predicted as Grade 3 and 9 as Grade 4).

\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

\vspace{.25in}

The Fine Tree algorithm regerssion plot (Figure \ref{fig2}) shows fairly good wind speed prediction of Grade 5 violent typhoon (maximum wind speeds of at least 105 knots/hr).
